*PRIDE mzGraph Browser* is a library for visualzing and annotating MS spectrum and chromatogram interactively. It includes features like:
 * Zoom in/out.

 * Save/Print spectrum and chromatogram as image.
 * Highlight peak m/z and intensity values.
 * Highlight mass differences. 
 * Display fragment ion annotations. 
 * Automatic annotation of amino acid identifications.
