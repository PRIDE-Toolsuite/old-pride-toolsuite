#summary PRIDE Converter 2 Documentation

= Introduction =

PRIDE Converter 2 is a complete rewrite of the previous version.

= Supported Formats =

Currently, PRIDE Converter 2 supports the following MS data formats:

|| *Format* || *Type* || *Status* ||
|| [MascotDatDAO Mascot .dat] || Identifications + Spectra || Tested on 6 submissions ||
|| X!Tandem || Identifications + (processed spectra) <br>Can process additional peak list files for spectra || Complete. Not tested ||
|| mzIdentML || Identifications + spectra in additional file || Complete. Not tested ||
|| OMSSA || Identifications + Spectra || Under development ||
|| dta || Spectra || Complete. Not tested ||
|| mgf || Spectra || Complete. Not tested ||
|| ms2 || Spectra || Complete. Not tested ||
|| mzML || Spectra || Complete. Not tested ||
|| mzXML || Spectra || Complete. Not tested ||
|| pkl || Spectra || Complete. Not tested ||

= Supported additional data =

Additional data is generally extracted from mzTab files. A "skeleton" mzTab file can be generated using the new PRIDE Converter when setting "mztab" as mode. This generates a basic mzTab file based on the search engine's input file. This file can then be used to add quantitative / gel based data as described below.

== Special mzTab fields ==

Some fields / values can be supplied using defined optional columns. The more "simpler" fields are summarised in the following table:

|| *Column Header* || *Level* || *Description* ||
|| opt_empai || Protein || The emPAI for the given protein. This value is mapped to the cvParam PRIDE:0000363 "emPAI value". ||
|| opt_tic || Protein, Peptide || The Total Ion Count (TIC) for the given protein or peptide. This valus is mapped to the cvParam PRIDE:0000364 "TIC value". ||

===Quantiative data===

Quantitative data should be reported as defined by the mzTab format specification. This information is then automatically parsed by PRIDE Converter.

===Gel-based data===
