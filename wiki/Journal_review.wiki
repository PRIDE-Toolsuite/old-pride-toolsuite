= Introduction =

As an integrated desktop application for visualizing and analysing MS datasets, PRIDE Inspector was created to help data submitters, journal editors, and journal reviewers to visualize, browse and assess proteomics experimental data. 

We have been using PRIDE Inspector within the PRIDE team since its release into production in our own reviews of manuscripts and are convinced of its ability to make the reviewing process easier. Below we highlight some of the features facilitating the journal reviewing process.  

= Journal Reviewing =

As an example, we invite you to give it a try with data from Mike Dunnâ€™s group, present in PRIDE (McManus et al., 2010, PMID: 20432482). The manuscript related information has been kept private on purpose to show the functionality of PRIDE Inspector. The process described here would be exactly the same for any potential reviewer.

== Using the online version ==

To launch PRIDE Inspector with direct access to the dataset mentioned above, you need to have Java Webstart installed.

Please access [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/jsp/pages/jnlp/jnlp.jsp?username=review02342&password=nsqNx4tt online version] then follow the instructions. This option will automatically download and open the experiments and ready to be reviewed. 

Please note that If you are using Google Chrome, you will need to double click the downloaded .jnlp file to launch PRIDE Inspector.
 
If you don't have Java Web Start installed, you can install PRIDE Inspector locally. For detailed instructions please see below. 

== Using the desktop version == 

  # Ensure you have a recent version of Java installed.
  #  Download the PRIDE Inspector application from [http://code.google.com/p/pride-toolsuite/ PRIDE toolsuite] (See "Feature downloads" on the right block. The last version available will appear there).
  # Once installed, go to that directory in your local computer and double click the corresponding version pride-inspector.jar file. The application will then start.
  # In the PRIDE Inspector "Welcome" page click on "Private Download".
  # A window will pop up. There you need to enter your username and password (it would be the same process for a reviewer account), and click on "Login". Please use as an example: Username : *review02342*  Password: *nsqNx4tt*
  # The experiments that belong to that account will be listed there (see screenshot below).

=  Quick quality assessment =
PRIDE Inspector offers three quick ways of assessing the overall quality of the experiment: *Experiment Summary*, *Summary Charts* and *Experiment Overview* 

=== Experiment Summary ===
The Experiment Summary panel is located on the bottom-left of the PRIDE Inspector, it offers a snapshot view of the experiment, and is the quickest way of spotting if something looks amiss with the dataset. It shows whether protein identifications, peptide identifications and spectra are present and also shows different types of post translational modifications present in the experiment (See screenshot below).

=== Summary Charts ===
The Summary Charts Tab provides a set of charts showing different representation of the data contained in the selected experiment. It offers reviewers a quick way of assess the overall quality of the experiment using:

  * *Peak Intensity Distribution Charge* : A histogram of ion intensity vs frequency for all MS2 spectra in the experiment.
  * *Precursor Ion Charge Distribution* : Displays a bar chart of precursor ion charges.
  * *Average MS/MS spectrum* : Displays the average MS/MS spectrum.
  * *Distribution of Precursor Ion Masses* : Displays a frequency distribution of product ion m/z for different precursor ion charges.
  * *Number of Peptides Identified per Protein* : Displays a bar chart with the number of peptides identified per protein.
  * *Number of Peaks per Spectrum* : Displays a histogram of number of peaks per MS/MS spectrum.
  * *Delta m/z* : Displays a relative frequency distribution of theoretical precursor ion mass - experimental precursor ion mass.
  * *Number of Missed Tryptic Cleavages* : Displays the number of missed tryptic cleavages.

=== Experiment Overview ===
The Experiment Overview Tab provides a unified view on the metadata of different types of data sources. It is arranged in a series of three panels, each panel showing a specific type of metadata. The type of metadata is indicated by the panel's title. Each panel can be viewed by clicking on the button at the top of the Experiment Overview Tab (See screenshot below).

You can find out more on the overall information about the experiment, sample details, experiment protocol, MS instrument details and software used for data processing.

= Detailed quality assessment =
 For detailed quality assessment of a experiment, we recommend you use Protein Tab, Peptide Tab and Spectrum/Chromatogram Tab. Below is a short summary on each Tab's main functionality, for detailed guide, please refer to the help document embedded in the PRIDE Inspector.

=== Protein Tab ===
The Protein Tab provides a protein identification-centric view. It displays all identified proteins. For each protein identification, its related peptide spectrum matches are also displayed. Please note that it is possible to sort the table based on most table headings, so it is possible to instantly focus on proteins having very low or very high numbers of peptides, or those having PTM annotations. (See screenshot below)

=== Peptide Tab ===
The Peptide Tab provides a peptide-centric view. All identified peptides are displayed in this area, along with their post translational modifications and spectra. (See screenshot below)

http://pride-toolsuite.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/screenshots/journal-review/protein_tab.png

For those peptides with PTM annotations, it is possible to visualize the peak annotations by enabling amino acid annotations. The modified amino acids will have a (*) symbol next to them (not shown). 

=== Spectrum/Chromatogram Tab ===
The Spectrum/Chromatogram Tab provides a spectrum/chromatogram-centric view. All spectra and chromatogram from the data source are displayed in this area. (See screenshot below)
