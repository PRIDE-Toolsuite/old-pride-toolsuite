== About PRIDE Quality Chart==

The purpose of PRIDE Chart library is to provide a tool for creating a set of chart in order to show the quality of the data in everyone of the PRIDE Expermients.

Currently, the library provides eight different charts:
 # *Peak Intensity Distribution Chart*: A histogram of ion intensity vs frequency for all MS2 spectra in a single PRIDE experiment. 
 # *Precursor Ion Charge Distribution Chart*: Displays a bar chart of precursor ion charge for a single PRIDE experiment.
 # *MS2 m/z Distribution Chart*: Displays a frequency distribution of product ion m/z for different precursor ion charges. 
 # *Distribution of Precursor Ion Masses Chart*: Displays a frequency distribution of product ion m/z for different precursor ion charges.
 # *Number of Peptides Identified per Protein Chart*: Displays a bar chart with the number of peptides identified per protein for a single PRIDE experiment.
 # *Number of Peaks per Spectrum Chart*: Displays a histogram of number of peaks per MS/MS spectrum in a single PRIDE experiment. 
 # *Delta m/z Chart*: Displays a normalised frequency distribution of theoretical precursor ion mass - experimental precursor ion mass. 
 # *Number of Missed Tryptic Cleavages Chart*: . 

Note: the library is still evolving, we are committed to expand this library and add more useful charts. 

PRIDE Chart library is currently used by one project:
 * [PRIDEInspector PRIDE Inspector]

This library is written in Java, brought to you by the PRIDE team.

== Getting PRIDE Quality Chart==
The zip file in the [http://code.google.com/p/pride-toolsuite/downloads/list downloads section] contains the *PRIDE Chart* jar file and all other required libraries.

===Maven Dependency===
*PRIDE Utilities* library can be used in Maven projects, you can include the following snippets in your Maven pom file. 
{{{
 <dependency>
   <groupId>uk.ac.ebi.pride.chart</groupId>
   <artifactId>pride-chart</artifactId>
   <version>0.0.20</version>

== Using PRIDE Quality Chart==
Here we will show you how to use the PRIDE Chart library to create all the charts associated to a PRIDE Experimet Accession Number (stored in the public PRIDE-database), how to store the intermediate data and how to reuse it instead of calculated it again.

==== Creating all the charts associated to a PRIDE Experimet Accession Number ====
Note. If you've download the code from the SVN, make sure that you've configured correctly the database access. If you're using the project as a library, then the connection to the database is already configured.

You can find the class `PrideChartSummaryData` for calculating the experiment summary data in *uk.ac.ebi.pride.chart.controller* package. It requires one input parameter: 
 * `accessionNumber` is the PRIDE Experiment Accession Number in `String`. 

The following lines of code shows you how: 
{{{
//The PRIDE Experiment Accession Number we are interested in
String accessionNumber = "9759";

//The future list of PrideChart
List<PrideChart> listOfCharts;
try {
    //Using PrideChartSummaryData only with the accesion number STRING, it will use
    ExperimentSummaryData summaryData = new PrideChartSummaryData(accessionNumber);
    listOfCharts = PrideChartFactory.getAllCharts(spectralSummaryData);
} catch (SpectralDataPerExperimentException e) {
    listOfCharts = new ArrayList<PrideChart>(); //An empty list
    //Treat the exception
}
//If everything was fine, here listOfCharts contains the charts associated
}}}
