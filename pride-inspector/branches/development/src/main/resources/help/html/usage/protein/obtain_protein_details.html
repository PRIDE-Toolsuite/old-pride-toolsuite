            Extra protein related details can be downloaded from remote web services, such as: Uniprot, IPI, Ensembl and
            NCBI. This feature can be accessed from the top right of the protein tab, the peptide tab and the
            quantification
            tab. In addition, it can be called from the Protein Sequence Viewer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Four types of information will be donwloaded:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="#name">Protein Name</a> - protein name assigned to the mapped protein accession.
            </li>
            <li><a href="#status">Status</a> - the status of the protein accession according to the remote web service.
            </li>
            <li><a href="#sequence">Protein Sequence</a> - protein sequence related to the mapped protein accession.
            </li>
            <li><a href="#peptide">Fit in Sequence</a> - whether a given peptide can be found in the protein sequence.

                <h3>Protein Name</h3>

                <p>
                    Protein names are downloaded using the mapped protein accession. There are cases where the protein
                    names will not be available, possible reasons are:
                <ul>
                    <li>No valid mapped protein accession</li>
                    <li>Protein accession has been deleted from the original database</li>
                    <li>Protein accession is unknown to the original database</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Status</h3>

                <p>
                    The status field indicates the status of the protein accession according to the original database.
                    It could be one of the following status:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Active</b>: the protein accession still exists in the original database, and the details
                        remain unchanged.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Unknown</b>: the protein accession does not exist in the original database.</li>
                    <li><b>Deleted</b>: the protein accession has been removed from the original database.</li>
                    <li><b>Merged</b>: the protein accession has been merged with other protein accession to form a new
                        protein.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Demerged</b>: the protein accession has been splited into two or more proteins.</li>
                    <li><b>Changed</b>: there has been some changes on this protein.</li>
                    <li><b>Error</b>: there is an error associated with this protein.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Protein Sequence</h3>

                <p>
                    The latest protein sequence form the original database, this might be different from the original
                    sequences used for the search. In some cases, the protein sequence won't be available, for example,
                    when a protein accession is demerged into multiple proteins.

                <p>
                    This field indicates whether the peptide sequence can still be found in the latest protein sequence.
                    It could be one of the following status:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Fit</b>: both the peptide sequence and the start/stop position fits the protein sequence.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Fuzzy Fit</b>: only the peptide sequence can be found in the protein sequence, this may
                        indicates a change of the original protein sequence.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>No Fit</b>: the peptide sequence can not be found in the protein sequence.</li>
                    <li><b>Unknown</b>: When the protein sequence is not available.
                    </li>
